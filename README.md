# Microbial_Super_Team


## Background

We were interested in identifying species compostion from Oyster beds and Mud Flats (Great Bay, NH) and how their compostion in the two communites differ within the same body of water. 

Author et al. 2019 assembled the genome of ... 

## Methods

Author et al. 2019 sequences we downloaded from ...

Our files that were obtained by ... were in fastqgz and qza files for taxonomy.

We installed qiime2 programs with a conda environment to analyze the 16s ribsomal RNA sequences and create visual figures to express findings of the microbial compostions differences between Oyster Beds and Mud Flats. We ran our analysis on a laptop utilizing the conda environment and qiime2 programs.

We ran into this issue...
